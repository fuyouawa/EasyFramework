object

{member1: 1, member2: 2, member3: 3, member4: 4} -> 1234

{member1: 1, } -> 1

{member1: ["a", "b", "c"], } -> abc

{member1: {submember: "yes"} } -> yes

array access on object:
x = {member1: {submember: "no"} } x["member1"]["submember"] -> no

Test multilines
x = {
member1: 1, member2:
3,
member3: 3
,
member4: 4} ->
1234
